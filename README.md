# git-rewrite-all

did you screw up all your git commit names and your csp teacher's midterm is checking your commit history and dates? this is exactly what you need

```sh
# run this inside the desired git repository
curl -s -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safinsingh/git-rewrite-all/master/git-rewrite-all.sh > git-rw
bash git-rw
```

> if it gives you an error saying that curl isn't installed:

```sh
sudo apt install curl
```
